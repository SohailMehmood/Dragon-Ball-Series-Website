Welcome to the Dragon Ball Series Website! This platform is dedicated to all Dragon Ball enthusiasts out there.

## UX

### Colour Scheme

The website employs a dynamic colour scheme to enhance the user experience:

- `#1c4595` used for primary text and navigation highlight.
- `#e76a24` used for secondary text, underlines and shadows.
- `#01080a` used for headers and shadows.
- `#e7e5e8` used for background color.
- `#fbbc42` used for navigation text and standard highlight.

I used [loading.io](https://loading.io/color/feature/DragonBall-%E3%83%89%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B4%E3%83%B3%E3%83%9C%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB/) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## Wireframes

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.
