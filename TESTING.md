## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

| Page | W3C URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home | [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fsohailmehmood.github.io%2FDragon-Ball-Series-Website%2Findex.html) | ![screenshot](documentation/index-validation.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| Dragonball | [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fsohailmehmood.github.io%2FDragon-Ball-Series-Website%2Fdragonball.html) | ![screenshot](documentation/dragonball-validation.png) | Section Lack Heading Warnings |

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

| File | Jigsaw URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| style.css | [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri%253Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fsohailmehmood.github.io%252FDragon-Ball-Series-Website%252Findex.html%2526profile%253Dcss3svg%2526usermedium%253Dall%2526warning%253D1%2526vextwarning%253D%2526lang%253Den) | ![screenshot](documentation/index-validation-css.png) | Pass: No Errors |

## Browser Compatibility

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.

| Browser | Home | About | Contact | etc | Notes |

## Responsiveness

I've tested my deployed project on multiple devices to check for responsiveness issues.

## Lighthouse Audit

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site's Lighthouse Audit reports.
Avoid testing the local version (especially if developing in Gitpod), as this can have knock-on effects of performance.

If you don't have Lighthouse in your Developer Tools,
it can be added as an [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk).

Don't just test the home page (unless it's a single-page application).
Make sure to test the Lighthouse Audit results for all of your pages.

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the results, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Sample Lighthouse testing documentation:

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues.
