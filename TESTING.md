# Testing

Return back to the [README.md](README.md) file.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

In this section, you need to convince the assessors that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well.
Essentially, in this part, you should go over all of your project's features, and ensure that they all work as intended,
with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

## Code Validation

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

Use the space to discuss code validation for any of your own code files (where applicable).
You are not required to validate external libraries/frameworks, such as imported Bootstrap, Materialize, Font Awesome, etc.

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide a screenshot for each file you validate.

**PRO TIP**: Always validate the live site pages, not your local code. There could be subtle/hidden differences.

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

- If you are copying/pasting your HTML code, use this link: https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input
- (*recommended*) If you are using the live deployed site pages, use this link: https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri

It's recommended to validate the live pages (each of them) using the deployed URL.
This will give you a custom URL as well, which you can use on your testing documentation.
It makes it easier to return back to a page to validate it again in the future.
The URL will look something like this:

- https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2FSohailMehmood.github.io%2FDragon-Ball-Series-Website%2Findex.html

Sample HTML code validation documentation (tables are extremely helpful!):

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

| Page | W3C URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home | [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2FSohailMehmood.github.io%2FDragon-Ball-Series-Website%2Findex.html) | ![screenshot](documentation/html-validation-home.png) | Section lacks header h2-h6 warning |

| Checkout | n/a | ![screenshot](documentation/html-validation-checkout.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| x | x | x | repeat for all remaining HTML files |

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

- If you are copying/pasting your HTML code, use this link: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input
- (*recommended*) If you are using the live deployed site, use this link: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_uri

It's recommended to validate the live site if you only have a single CSS file using the deployed URL.
This will give you a custom URL as well, which you can use on your testing documentation.
It makes it easier to return back to the page to validate it again in the future.
The URL will look something like this:

- https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2FSohailMehmood.github.io%2FDragon-Ball-Series-Website

If you have multiple CSS files, then individual [validation by input](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)
is recommended for the additional CSS files.

**IMPORTANT**: Third-Party tools

If you're using extras like Bootstrap, Materialize, Font Awesome, then sometimes the validator
will attempt to also validate this code, even if it's not part of your own actual code.
You are not required to validate the external libraries or frameworks!

## Browser Compatibility

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site on various browsers.

Consider testing at least 3 different browsers, if available on your system.

Recommended browsers to consider:
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)
- [Firefox (Developer Edition)](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/developer)
- [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge)
- [Safari](https://support.apple.com/downloads/safari)
- [Brave](https://brave.com/download)
- [Opera](https://www.opera.com/download)

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the tested browsers, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Please note, there are services out there that can test multiple browser compatibilities at the same time.
Some of these are paid services, but some are free.
If you use these, you must provide a link to the source used for attribution, and multiple screenshots of the results.

Sample browser testing documentation:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.

## Responsiveness

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site on various device sizes.

The minimum requirement is for the following 3 tests:
- Mobile
- Tablet
- Desktop

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the tested responsiveness, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Using the "amiresponsive" mockup image (or similar) does not suffice the requirements.
Consider using some of the built-in device sizes in the Developer Tools.

If you have tested the project on your actual mobile phone or tablet, consider also including screenshots of these as well.
It showcases a higher level of manual tests, and can be seen as a positive inclusion!

## Lighthouse Audit

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site's Lighthouse Audit reports.
Avoid testing the local version (especially if developing in Gitpod), as this can have knock-on effects of performance.

If you don't have Lighthouse in your Developer Tools,
it can be added as an [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk).

Don't just test the home page (unless it's a single-page application).
Make sure to test the Lighthouse Audit results for all of your pages.

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the results, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Sample Lighthouse testing documentation:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues.
