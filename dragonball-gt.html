                <p>Dragon Ball GT is the third anime series in the Dragon Ball franchise and a sequel to the Dragon Ball
                    Z
                    anime series. Produced by Toei Animation, the series premiered in Japan on Fuji TV on February 7,
                    1996,
                    spanning 64 episodes until its conclusion on November 19, 1997.<br>
                    Unlike the previous two anime in the Dragon Ball franchise, Dragon Ball GT does not adapt the manga
                    by
                    Akira Toriyama, but is a sequel show to the Dragon Ball Z anime with an original story using the
                    same
                    characters and universe. The series follows the adventures of the protagonist Goku, who, along with
                    his
                    companions, defends the Earth against an assortment of villains ranging from intergalactic space
                    fighters
                    and conquerors, unnaturally powerful androids and near indestructible magical creatures. While the
                    original Dragon Ball anime followed Goku from childhood to early adulthood, Dragon Ball GT is a
                    continuation of his adult life, but is not considered a part of the Dragon Ball storyline by creator
                    Akira Toriyama.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>The Black Star Dragon Ball Saga is a notable storyline within the Dragon Ball GT series, a sequel to
                    the immensely popular Dragon Ball Z anime and manga. This saga introduces a fresh and compelling
                    narrative that takes the beloved characters on a new and perilous adventure.<br>
                    The saga kicks off when Emperor Pilaf accidentally wishes for Goku to revert to his child form using
                    the Black Star Dragon Balls, a set of mystical orbs scattered across the galaxy. Unlike the
                    traditional Dragon Balls, these have a dark history and a severe consequence attached to their use.
                    Upon Goku's transformation, a countdown is triggered, giving the Z Fighters a limited timeframe to
                    retrieve the scattered Black Star Dragon Balls before the Earth is destroyed.<br>
                    This quest sends Goku, along with his granddaughter Pan and the once-villainous Trunks, on a
                    spacefaring adventure across various planets. The stakes are raised as they encounter powerful foes,
                    including the infamous Baby, a parasitic entity seeking revenge against the Saiyan race. The
                    narrative takes unexpected turns, exploring themes of identity, loyalty, and the consequences of
                    meddling with the mystical forces that govern the Dragon Ball universe.<br>
                    The Black Star Dragon Ball Saga combines elements of space opera and classic Dragon Ball action,
                    offering fans a unique and thrilling twist on the familiar formula. The diverse settings, formidable
                    adversaries, and the ticking clock create a sense of urgency that sets this saga apart from its
                    predecessors, making it a memorable and captivating chapter in the larger Dragon Ball franchise.</p>

            <h2>Baby Saga</h2>

                </figure>
                <p>The Baby Saga is a compelling storyline within the Dragon Ball GT series, marking a significant
                    chapter in the adventures of Goku, Pan, and Trunks as they traverse the galaxy in search of the
                    Black Star Dragon Balls. This saga introduces the formidable antagonist known as Baby, a parasitic
                    entity with a deep-seated grudge against the Saiyan race.<br>
                    The narrative unfolds when the group arrives on the planet Imecka in pursuit of the Black Star
                    Dragon Balls. There, they encounter the tyrannical Don Kee and his oppressive rule over the
                    populace. The situation takes a dramatic turn when the parasitic Tuffle survivor, Baby, latches onto
                    the vulnerable Saiyan host, Vegeta, and takes control of his body. With Baby's newfound power and
                    Vegeta's strength, the once-friendly Saiyan prince transforms into a formidable adversary, setting
                    the stage for a fierce confrontation.<br>
                    The Baby Saga delves into themes of revenge, betrayal, and the consequences of past actions. Baby's
                    motivation stems from the tragic history of the Tuffles, who were annihilated by the Saiyans in the
                    past. Seeking to reclaim what was lost, Baby sets out to exterminate the Saiyan race and establish
                    Tuffle dominance. This vendetta leads to intense battles between Goku, his friends, and the
                    possessed Vegeta, testing their loyalties and the strength of their bonds.<br>
                    Throughout the saga, the Z Fighters face formidable challenges as Baby evolves and becomes
                    increasingly powerful. The storyline showcases the emotional and physical toll of the conflict, as
                    characters are forced to confront their own vulnerabilities and make difficult choices in the face
                    of a relentless adversary.<br>
                    The Baby Saga in Dragon Ball GT is known for its dynamic action sequences, complex character
                    development, and the exploration of the Saiyan-Tuffle conflict, providing fans with a gripping and
                    memorable addition to the Dragon Ball universe.</p>

                    past, collaborate to create a fusion between two of the deadliest androids: Android 17 and Hell
                    Fighter 17. This unholy union gives rise to the formidable Super Android 17, a mechanical menace

                    resurrected villains Cell and Frieza, to combat the common threat posed by Super 17. This alliance
                    sets the stage for epic and unpredictable battles, blurring the lines between friend and foe.<br>
                    The Super 17 Saga is known for its high-stakes action, unexpected twists, and the exploration of the
                    consequences of human and technological ambition. While Dragon Ball GT received mixed reviews for
                    its departure from the original manga's storyline, the Super 17 Saga remains a noteworthy and
                    entertaining chapter within the larger Dragon Ball universe.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>The Shadow Dragon Saga serves as the climactic conclusion to the Dragon Ball GT series, delivering a
                    riveting narrative that explores the unintended consequences of using the Dragon Balls. This saga
                    takes a dark and introspective turn as it introduces a new set of adversaries, the Shadow Dragons,
                    born from the negative energy accumulated over years of Dragon Ball misuse.<br>
                    The story unfolds when the Z Fighters, having completed their quest for the Black Star Dragon Balls,
                    discover that the Earth's Dragon Balls have been overused and contaminated with negative energy.
                    This leads to the emergence of seven malevolent dragons, each representing a different aspect of the
                    Dragon Balls' abuse. These Shadow Dragons, with powerful and destructive abilities, threaten to
                    bring about the end of the world.<br>
                    Goku and his companions find themselves in a race against time as they confront each Shadow Dragon,
                    facing moral dilemmas and powerful foes with personal ties to the Dragon Ball legacy. The saga not
                    only showcases intense battles but also delves into the consequences of unchecked power and the
                    responsibility that comes with wielding such extraordinary artifacts.<br>
                    One of the standout elements of the Shadow Dragon Saga is the emotional weight carried by the
                    storyline. Goku, driven by a deep sense of responsibility, faces the consequences of his past
                    actions and seeks to make amends for the unintended chaos caused by the Dragon Balls. The saga
                    explores themes of redemption, sacrifice, and the cyclical nature of power and its impact on the
                    world.<br>
                    As the Z Fighters battle the Shadow Dragons one by one, the stakes continue to rise, culminating in
                    a final confrontation that tests the limits of their strength, resolve, and the very fabric of the
                    Dragon Ball universe. The Shadow Dragon Saga is praised for its thought-provoking narrative,
                    emotional depth, and the satisfying resolution it provides to the Dragon Ball GT series.</p>
