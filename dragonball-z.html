                <p>The Raditz Saga is a pivotal story arc in the "Dragon Ball Z" series, the sequel to the original
                    "Dragon
                    Ball" anime. This saga marks a significant shift in the narrative and introduces the concept of
                    Saiyans, a
                    powerful warrior race from outer space.<br>
                    The story begins with the arrival of Raditz, Goku's long-lost brother, who reveals Goku's Saiyan
                    heritage
                    and his true name, Kakarot. Raditz informs Goku that he is a Saiyan sent to Earth as a baby to
                    conquer the
                    planet, but a head injury as a child caused him to lose his violent nature. Raditz attempts to
                    recruit Goku
                    for their mission, but Goku refuses, leading to a fierce battle between the two Saiyan brothers.<br>
                    Recognizing the impending threat, Goku's friends and former rivals, including Piccolo, Krillin,
                    Yamcha,
                    Tien, and Chiaotzu, join forces to confront Raditz. Unfortunately, Raditz proves to be a formidable
                    opponent, forcing Goku and Piccolo to form an uneasy alliance to defeat him. The battle results in a
                    sacrifice as Goku holds Raditz in place, allowing Piccolo to deliver a fatal blow to both of
                    them.<br>
                    The fallout from the Saiyan Saga sets the stage for even greater challenges, as it is revealed that
                    two more
                    powerful Saiyans, Vegeta and Nappa, are on their way to Earth. The saga ends with the remaining Z
                    Fighters
                    preparing for the imminent arrival of these formidable adversaries, laying the groundwork for the
                    epic
                    battles and transformations that define the subsequent arcs of "Dragon Ball Z.
