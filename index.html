            <h2>Introduction to the Dragon Ball Universe.</h2>
            <p>The Dragon Ball universe is a vast and iconic fictional realm that serves as the backdrop for a popular
                and influential Japanese media franchise. Created by Akira Toriyama, the franchise first debuted as a
                manga series in 1984 and later evolved into an anime series, video games, movies, and various other
                forms of media. At the core of the Dragon Ball universe is the story of Son Goku, a Saiyan warrior with
                incredible martial arts skills and a seemingly insatiable appetite for adventure.</p>

            <p>The narrative unfolds across multiple sagas, each marked by intense battles, powerful foes, and the
                pursuit of legendary Dragon Ballsâ€”mystical orbs that, when gathered, grant the possessor a wish from the
                eternal dragon Shenron. Over the course of the series, Goku and his diverse group of allies, including
                iconic characters like Vegeta, Piccolo, and Bulma, face formidable adversaries ranging from powerful
                extraterrestrial beings to androids and interdimensional threats.</p>

            <p>The Dragon Ball universe is renowned for its dynamic and intense martial arts battles, a unique blend of
                humor and action, and its exploration of themes such as friendship, perseverance, and the constant
                pursuit of self-improvement. The franchise has left an indelible mark on popular culture and has
                garnered a massive global fanbase, making it a timeless and beloved part of the anime and manga
                landscape.</p>
