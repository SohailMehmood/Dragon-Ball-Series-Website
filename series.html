        <p>Dragon Ball" is a Japanese anime series created by Akira Toriyama. It is based on his manga of the same name
            and was originally serialized in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump from 1984 to 1995. The anime adaptation, simply titled
            "Dragon Ball," first aired in Japan from February 26, 1986, to April 19, 1989.<br>
            The story follows the adventures of Son Goku, a young and naive boy with a monkey tail, as he embarks on a
            quest to find the seven Dragon Balls. These magical orbs, when gathered together, summon the wish-granting
            dragon Shenron.<br>
            As the series progresses, Goku trains under different martial arts masters, participates in tournaments, and
            faces formidable enemies.

    <h2>Emperor Pilaf Saga</h2>
    <section class="series-container">
        <p>The Emperor Pilaf Saga is the initial story arc in the original "Dragon Ball" anime series. It introduces
            viewers to the young and adventurous Goku as he begins his journey to find the mystical Dragon Balls. In
            this saga, Goku encounters Bulma, a brilliant inventor, and the two set off together on a quest to collect
            all seven Dragon Balls.<br>
            The primary antagonist of this saga is Emperor Pilaf, a diminutive and scheming ruler with ambitions of
            world domination. Pilaf discovers Goku and Bulma's quest and becomes determined to steal the Dragon Balls
            for himself. Along the way, Goku and Bulma befriend a shape-shifting dog named Oolong and a skilled martial
            artist named Yamcha.<br>
            As the group faces various challenges and obstacles, including encounters with dangerous creatures and rival
            martial artists, Emperor Pilaf becomes a persistent threat. The saga climaxes with a showdown at Pilaf's
            castle, where the fate of the Dragon Balls and the world hangs in the balance.<br>
            The Emperor Pilaf Saga sets the stage for Goku's epic adventures, establishing key characters and laying the
            foundation for the overarching narrative that unfolds in the subsequent arcs of the "Dragon Ball" series.
